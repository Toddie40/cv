      "Following the success of the FSS bid, it was time to deliver the project for real.",
      "I remained responsible for the same systems as the bid phase, however needed to take the maturity of the design to a much deeper level.",
      "There was a lot of interdisciplinary integration, especially for key transversal systems such as High Pressure Sea Water.",
      "One of the key differences at this stage was the customer engagement. I had to demonstrate to the MoD that my systems were robust, to standard and met their bespoke set of needs."
