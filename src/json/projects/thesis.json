    "details": [
      "Denied lab-time by the onset of Covid-19, my Master's Thesis revolved around the applicability of finite element analsys techniques on soft robotics.",
      "Specifically, on the use of FEA to model elastomeric materials such as silicone when put under significant deformation",
      "This project focussed on the soft robotics domain. It involved me combing through the scientific literature on soft robotics to find examples of pressure-driven, silicone actuators. I would then create 3-D models of the actuators in Autodesk Inventor and then constrain them and pressurise them using Abaqus. I would then compare the predicted deformation from the finite element analysi with the measured deformations in the scientific papers to ascertain the predictive power of FEA under non-linear conditions.",
      "Overall the project turned out to be successful, with FEA proving to be a powerful tool in the development of Soft Robotic Actuators, provided that good elastomeric data was accessible to provide a custom stress-strain curve to the software."
