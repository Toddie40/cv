      "This is a project that I took from a small moon-shot idea into a fully-fledged product that we're beginning to roll out internally.",
      "I developed the machine learning pipeline myself. Starting with a blank jupyter notebook and ending with a fully-containerised API with automatic image logging for continuous retraining and improvement.",
      "To demo the model and show-off its potential, I built a small web app in ReactJS that allows users to take a photo and send it to the API to return a classification.",
      "I have since produced a full project scoping outline and secured funding to begin writing a cloud-based API and database solution."
